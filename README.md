# Full Fibre Back-End Technical Test API Template

This branch uses a python script to automate the testing of my solution for the SQL request question. I could have gone full `pytest` here, but didn't see much need for it, as a single test could cover the use case.

### Setup

This application requires Python 3.8.

To run this test, simply run the `test/run.py` file, this will output the result in the host console. You won't need create a virtual environment or install any libraries.

```ps1
py test/run.py
```

### Usage

`database_setup.sql` has been enhanced with extra data that are relevant for the use case presented in the question.
